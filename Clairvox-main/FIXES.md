# COMMON ERRORS AND FIXES

## Issue: Wikipedia 404 Error

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:root:Error fetching Wikipedia summary for 'Does intermittent fasting improve weight loss?': 
404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/...
```

**Root Cause:** 
Wikipedia's API expects article titles (e.g., "Intermittent fasting"), not full questions.

**âœ… FIXED:**
The code has been updated to:
1. Extract the main topic from questions automatically
2. Fall back to Wikipedia search if direct lookup fails
3. Gracefully handle failures and continue with web search only

**What Changed:**
- `backend/retriever.py`: Added `extract_topic_from_query()` function
- `app.py`: Added fallback when Wikipedia context is unavailable

## Testing After Fixes

Try these test queries:

1. **Good Query (has Wikipedia article):**
   - "Does intermittent fasting improve weight loss?"
   - Should now extract "intermittent fasting" and find Wikipedia page

2. **Query without direct Wikipedia match:**
   - "What are the best practices for remote work?"
   - Should gracefully fall back to web search only

3. **Technical Query:**
   - "How does blockchain technology work?"
   - Should find Wikipedia page for "blockchain technology"
