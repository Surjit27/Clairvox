# Notebooks Directory

This directory stores dynamically generated Jupyter notebooks for reproducible evidence verification.

Notebooks are generated when you click "Download Reproducible Notebook" in the Clairvox UI.

Each notebook contains:
- The specific claim being verified
- Python code to fetch all evidence URLs
- Instructions for manual inspection

These notebooks can be opened in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for interactive execution.
